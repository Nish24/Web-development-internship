# Web-development-internship

The project's goal was to create a secure and user-friendly platform where employees could log in to retrieve details such as their name, date of birth, employee ID, salary, medical benefits, and professional metrics like targets and achievements. The site was built using HTML5, CSS, and Javascript, which not only enhanced its aesthetics but also added interactive elements. To ensure security, Google's Firebase platform was employed for email authentication, and employee data was stored in the Firestore cloud database.
